# OpenCV_Deep-Computer-Vision-Model

Using Open CV to create a basic Face Recognition and Detection application.

Using Caer, Canaro and Tensorflow to make a Deep Computer Vision Model that can identify different characters from the Simpsons televison show.

This Repository also contains the code I implemented to learn the basics of OpenCV.
